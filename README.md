# 🎥 Movie Search Project  

Welcome to my first project on GitHub! This is a simple **Movie Search Application** that allows users to search for movies and view their details using data fetched from an API.

- View detailed information about each movie, including:
  - Title  
  - Release Year  
  - Overview  
  - Poster Image
